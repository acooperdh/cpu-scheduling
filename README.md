# cpu-scheduling
Implementation of 4 different CPU scheduling algorithms in C

Tasks are read in from a text file named TaskSpec. Each Task is on it's own line in the file 
and is structure by task number, arrival time, burst time. 

The Tasks are read in from the file and stored in a 4 queues, one for each algorithm. 

The algorithms are ran consecutively, FSCS, RR, NPSJF, PSJF and their results are outputed to
Output.txt
